Save the token locally:
    Pro: No need for extra network request.
	Con: In case the server wants to update or invalidate a token, we will use the older token.
	
re-request the token each time:
    Pro: we will get a token that the server wants to update or invalidate.
	Con: We flood the server with (maybe) unnecessary requests
